# MacGuffin

## Description
A film browser for your local system.  
**Very much a work in progress - currently only CLI**

### A note on naming
Everything seems to need some stupid name these days.
So, what better for a film related piece of code, than to have an otherwise
meaningless device for a name.

> In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin) is an object, device, or event that is necessary to the plot and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.
